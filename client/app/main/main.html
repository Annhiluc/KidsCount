      <span></span>
      <p>Kids Count is a 501(c)3 nonprofit organization that provides a free after school program for kindergarten through 3rd grade students in low performing elementary schools in Gainesville, Florida.</p>

      <br>

      <p><b>Our vision is to...</b></p>
      <ul>
      	<li>Provide an opportunity for students who need extra support in the community to succeed in school and life</li>
		<li>Partner with schools, churches, organizations, & businesses to offer a highly effective program</li>
		<li>Inspire hope, enhance learning, and improve self-confidence while building social skills & concern for others</li>
		<li>Provide qualified staff, volunteers, and expertise for the program</li>
	   </ul>

		<br>

		<p><b>We focus on three areas:</b> Academics, Social Skill Development, and Enrichment</p>
		<ol>
			<li><b>Academics:</b>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Math and Literacy Tutoring</b> - For one hour, twice a week, students work one-on-one with the University of Florida's College of Education tutors on math and literacy literacy skills. Each lesson is specifically designed for our student's individual needs.</li>
					<li><b>Homework Help</b> - Students are tutored one-on-one or in small groups with homework and supplemented with enrichment activities if they have no homework or get finished early.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><p><b>Social Skill Development:</b></p>
			<p> We teach one character trait a month through practice and reinforcement.  We creatively combine our Friday enrichment activities to go along with our traits.</p>
			</li>
			<li><p><b>Friday Enrichment:</b></p>
			<p> We reach out to the community by inviting guests or going on field trips. This provides fun learning experiences that our students may not otherwise have.</p>
			</li>
		</ol>

		<br>

		<p><b>Locations and Hours:</b></p>
		<p>We are now serving 50 students in grades K-3 (20 from Rawlings and 30 from Williams). Reaching more students has always been and will continue to be our goal.</p>
