      <p><b>Why should I volunteer with Kids Count? Because...</b></p>
      <ol>
      	<li>Fewer than 50% of Alachua County low-income students who entered 9th grade five years ago will graduate this year.</li>
		<li>Rawlings and Williams are two out of of five Alachua County elementary schools with over 85% of students coming from low-income families.</li>
		<li>Research has shown that if a child falls behind in reading as early as first grade, without intervention, there is little chance he will ever catch up with his peers.</li>
		<li>Standardized test scores of third grade students are used to predict future prison population. </li>
		<li>We commit to work passionately to provide the intervention needed to help our students succeed. </li>
		<li>We all lose when children don't grow and develop into all they can be. </li>
		<li>Kids Count is research based. </li>
		<li>We provide students one-on-one literacy tutoring with trained tutors.</li>
		<li>We work with the whole child to inspire a love of life and learning in our students through character development, education and special enrichment activities.</li>
      </ol>
